# Contract api

This API is meant to emulate the different contracts that you have with external systems

## use api based routing

You can use the first part of the URL as your contract and put your resources after that.
e.g, for `fake` you could do:

`URL/fake/trucks` and `URL/fake/containers`.
Then simply make `URL/fake` your root url in the React config
